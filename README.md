<h2> 💬 About me: </h2>

You might say I'm a bit of a nerd. I'm currently making the transition into the Information Technology field with a focus on Systems Engineering. I've been doing everything I can to improve my skills and gain exposure, and have produced and released content that is currently in use today (see below). Thank you for reviewing my portfolio!
